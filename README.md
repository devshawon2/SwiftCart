1) undefined: This means a variable has been declared but has not been assigned a value. It is the default state. null: This is an assigned value that indicates the intentional absence of any object value. You set something to null to signify that it is empty.
2) map(): This creates and returns a new array by applying a function to every element of the original array. forEach(): This executes a function for each element but returns nothing. Use it when you want to act, such as logging or updating the DOM, without creating a new list. 
3) == (Loose Equality): This compares values after converting them to a common type. For example, 5 == "5" is true. === (Strict Equality): This compares both value and type without any conversion. For instance, 5 === "5" is false. Always use === to prevent bugs. 
4) async: This declares that a function will return a promise. await: This pauses the function execution until the promise resolves. It helps avoid callback hell and makes error handling with try/catch much easier.
